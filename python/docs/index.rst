Welcome to interpret-community's documentation!
===============================================

Interpret-Community is an experimental repository extending `Interpret <https://github.com/interpretml/interpret>`_, with additional interpretability techniques and utility functions to handle real-world datasets and workflows for explaining models trained on **tabular data**.
This repository contains the Interpret-Community SDK and Jupyter notebooks with examples to showcase its use.

The code is `available from GitHub <https://github.com/interpretml/interpret-community>`_.

For the InterpretML organization, which interpret-community is part of, please see the common website at https://interpret.ml/.

The explanation dashboard, which is a web-based interface to the interpret-community code, is in the `responsible-ai-toolbox <https://github.com/microsoft/responsible-ai-toolbox/>`_ repository.

You can find the main documentation for the all-in-one Responsible AI Toolbox which uses interpret-community as the backend at https://responsibleaitoolbox.ai/.
