Interpret Community Extensions SDK
=============================================================


The Interpret Community Extensions builds on [InterpretML](https://github.com/Microsoft/interpret), an open source python package from Microsoft Research for training interpretable models and helping to explain blackbox systems, by adding additional extensions from the community to interpret ML models.

This repository contains an SDK and Jupyter notebooks with examples to showcase its use.

## Getting Started

This repo uses Anaconda to simplify package and environment management.

To setup on your local machine:

<details><summary><strong><em>1. Set up Environment</em></strong></summary>

    a. Install Anaconda with Python >= 3.6 
       [Miniconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) is a quick way to get started.

 
    b. Create conda environment named interp and install packages

```
    conda create --name interp python=3.6 anaconda
    
```

    Optional, additional reading:

    - [conda cheat sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf)
    - [jupyter](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/)
    - [nb_conda](https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/nb_conda)

<details><summary><strong><em>On Windows: c. Activate conda environment</strong></em></summary>

```
    activate interp
```
</details>

<details><summary><strong><em>On Linux:</em> c. Activate conda environment</em></strong></summary>

```
    source activate interp
```
</details>
<br></br>
</details>
 
<details>

<summary><strong><em>2. Clone the interpret-community repository</em></strong></summary>

Clone and cd into the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/Interpret-community
cd interpret-community
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong><em>3. Install Python module, packages and necessary distributions</em></strong></summary>


```
pip install -e ./python 
```
If you intend to run repo tests:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong><em>4. Set up and run Jupyter Notebook server </em></strong></summary>

Install and run Jupyter Notebook
```
if needed:
          pip install jupyter
          conda install nb_conda
then:
jupyter notebook
```

* The API supports both dense (numpy or pandas) and sparse (scipy) datasets

* For more advanced users, individual explainers can be used

* The TabularExplainer provides local and global feature importances  
    *  The best explainer is automatically chosen for the user based on the model
        - Best implies fastest execution time and highest interpretabilty accuracy.
* Local feature importances are for each evaluation row
* Global feature importances summarize the most importance features at the model-level
 * The KernelExplainer and MimicExplainer are for BlackBox models
 * The MimicExplainer is faster but less accurate than the KernelExplainer
 * The TreeExplainer is for tree-based models
 * The DeepExplainer is for DNN tensorflow or pytorch models
